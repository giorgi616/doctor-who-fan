    <h2> Generation One   </h2>
    
    <!--teqsti----------------------------------->
    <p><em>Generation One</em>, originally known as The Transformers, is the original Transformers franchise which took the United States by storm in 1984.

        The term "Generation One" (G1) was originally a fan-coined back-formulation of Generation 2. Until the Transformers: Generation 2 line was released, Generation One was simply called The Transformers. Over the years, the use of the term G1 has become fairly universal and has frequently been used in official materials. It has even appeared on Takara toy packaging and on Hasbro's official Transformers website and reissue toy packaging.</p>

<p>The Generation One franchise as it ran in the 1980s/90s featured the following primary components:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong><a href="#toy">A toyline</a></strong></li>
        <li><strong><a href="#multiki">A cartoon series</a></strong></li>
        <li><strong><a href="#comics">Several comic book series</a></strong></li>  
        
        <p>Generation One also included an avalanche of ancillary licensed merchandise, more so than any other Transformers franchise outside of Japan. This has resulted in a higher number of Micro-Continuities in G1 than in any other Transformers franchise. This licensing was revived in the early 2000s due to retro-appeal at retailers like Hot Topic. It has continued at varying levels of intensity since.</p>

    <h3>Japanese release</h3>
    <p>In Japan, rather than simply be identified as The Transformers throughout its lifespan, the franchise was rebranded with a new title and a shift in storytelling every year. This led to a collection of mini-franchises within the larger Generation One franchise, each featuring their own individual components. They are:</p>
    
    <li>
        <ul>1985 - Fight! Super Robot Lifeform Transformers</ul>
        <ul>1986 - Transformers 2010</ul>
<ul>1987 - The Headmasters</ul>
<ul>1988 - Super-God Masterforce</ul>
<ul>1989 - Victory</ul>
<ul>1990 - Zone</ul>
<ul>1991 - Return of Convoy</ul>
<ul>1992 - Operation Combination</ul>
</li>
     
      <h4>Continuations and addenda</h4>
    
    <p>It should be noted that the first two revivals/reinventions of the Transformers line following the end of the original line (Generation 2 and Beast Wars/Beast Machines) remained, as far as their fiction was concerned, as part of the same overall storyline/history framework. Thus a character like Optimus Primal is listed as being "a character from the Beast Era portion of the Generation One continuity family." Despite hailing from a later post-Generation One franchise, he is a part of the same Generation One continuity family.

Also of note, the lasting popularity of the original Generation One franchise, its characters, and stories have led Hasbro and Takara to produce a long stream of modern revisions of it. This new Generation One material is sometimes referred to by fans as "Neo G1".</p>

    <p> The Transformers (retroactively called Generation One or G1) started as a joint venture between two companies: Hasbro of America and Takara of Japan. After an idea to rebrand and sell Takara's Diaclone and Microchange robot toys as a whole new line with a new concept behind it, Hasbro unknowingly would wind up creating what would be one of its longest running franchises.</p>
    
    
    
    <h4 id="multiki">The Transformers (A cartoon series)</h4>
    <img src="https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/transformers/images/b/bd/G1Season1Logo.jpg/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/310?cb=20101003030908">
    <p>More than any other of the many media which Transformers have invaded in the past 20+ years, it is The Transformers, the original cartoon that ran from 1984 to 1987, which captured the imagination of adults who used to be children and children-at-heart worldwide back in the 80s.</p>
    <p>The cartoon (along with the Marvel comics) set up the basic story of Transformers that most other incarnations were to follow: two warring factions of robots on the planet Cybertron leave in search of resources. The factions crash-land on Earth and, millions of years later, begin their battle anew in Reagan-era America and across the globe.<br>

Once established, the cartoon rarely took any steps to upset its status quo. Plots generally centered on a Decepticon plot or invention of the week, which would be used to gather energy or Defeat The Autobots FOREVER!!, and the Autobots' efforts to stop the plan. Most of the time the Decepticons were forced into retreat, and the Autobots drove off victorious. At most, a new character or team was added to one side or the other. Plots became a bit less formulaic during Season 3, though character death and true plot upheaval remained a rarity.<br>
 Through its 98-episode run, this series took viewers around the globe and to many strange places and times: across the alien Cybertron, the Earth's prehistoric past, the Earth's then-future of 2005, the Metropolis-like society of Nebulos, and more. It is not the best animated series ever to air, but it stimulated viewers with its concept at the time, and continued to do so in the years to come.   </p>
    
     
    <h4 id="comics">Several comic book series</h4>
    <img src="https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/transformers/images/1/12/MarvelUS-01.jpg/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/250?cb=20060501043823">
    <p>The Transformers, the monthly comic book published in the U.S. by Marvel Comics, was the very first original fiction to feature the famous robots in disguise, as well as the longest-running. It started life as a four-issue, bimonthly limited series in 1984, but proved so popular that it continued publication as an ongoing monthly until spring of 1991. The series ultimately reached 80 issues and spun off several miniseries.<br>

The series established the Marvel Comics continuity, which would form the basis for several successor stories over the years.<br>

Nearly all of the U.S. stories were later published by Marvel UK, along with new stories that fit between the gaps of the U.S. tales. See Marvel UK below.<br></p>
